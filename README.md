# hello-world
My first repository

Hi world, My name is Shaho Sarhdi. I'm 17 years old and I'm have been so interested in computers since I was just5 years old.
I was 5 when my father came home with a computer one night. From the first setup I decided to love it. 
My first usages of computer were video games but soon I decided to explore my computers.
After 12 years I'm steal exploring and I'm very into coding and programming now. I love to learn Python
